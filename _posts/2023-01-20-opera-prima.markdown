Surely there is a conspiracy. There is always one. So, what are the intentions of any organization that directs its agents to generate conspiracy theories?
As usual, to hide an elephant behind a tea towel. After all, nothing more effective than redirection and suspicions confirmation to expend the sea of thought's processing power of the population.
It's cheaper than radiating microwaves or implanting nanochips to control the mind of the masses. It only takes a small push to keep us digging the rabbit hole deeper.

It doesn't take much to start one. And falling for one is even quicker.

Why we fall? That's a long one. But LSS, we hate not to know, and love to be right. A story that vaguely confirms something, that in the back of our mind, we suspect makes us feel right. It has a bonus, the feeling of knowing something that nobody else knows. Basic survival.

How not to fall? Think about the arguments, assess the evidence, and if necessary question what is presented as facts. IOW, make use of [Critical thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking).

Let's see...
- "Surely there is a conspiracy", well... no. There is not a conspiracy theory for most of the topics you an think of.
- "There is always one", No! But sentences like this predispose us into thinking about all the things we don't know but should know about.
- "So, what are the intentions of any organization that directs its agents to generate conspiracy theories?". Interesting choice of words, it can be as subtle as effective.
    - Words transmit information, of course, but also emotions.
        - "intentions". Why not... say... objectives? The connotation of intentions can be perceived as more obscure or negative than objectives.
        - "organizations". Something more general, harder to pinpoint. A company would be too precise.
        - "directs". Could be just "ask"?
        - "agents". Same as with "intentions", why not employees, or people?
        - How do we feel with: "What is the objective of a company that ask its employees to create suspicion confirmations?". Now it sounds like a question a journalist could tackle. But before that, let's bring more hidden assumptions to light.
    - By reading the question without stopping to question its assumptions, we are unconsciously accepting them.
        - The sentence hides behind the question the assumption that companies ask employees to create suspicion confirmations as it is questioning "why companies ask...", not "do companies ask employees to...?". The answer to the latter would be mostly not.


Want to change somebody mind about conspiracy theory? First, consider how much they have invested on it. Would changing the view threat the correctness of their previous decisions? For example, changing their view could involve accepting that because of the credulity they put their love ones in risk. That's a hard pill to swallow specially for a parent. It's easier to keep convincing yourself that everybody else is wrong but the group that think as you. So a change can't happen as a epiphany. It requires empathy, patience, and regeneration of the critical thinking tissue.

To be continued... with Bayesian thinking...
